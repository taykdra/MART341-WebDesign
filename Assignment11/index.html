        <p1> <b>Tangled</b> was by far one of my most favorite movies as a young girl. I saw it for the very first time on my eighth birthday, as I had unwrapped the movie case along with a green stuffed chameleon, who just so happened to be Rapunzel's best friend. This movie will forever hold a special place in my heart, and if you havenâ€™t seen it, I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, no matter what their age is. </p1>
