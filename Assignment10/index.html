        <em>Christmas</em> has always been my favorite holiday. As kids, our parents would dress my siblings and I up in the cutest Christmas outfits, and then take us to visit Santa. This was one of my favorite traditions as a child, and I plan on carrying this tradition on when I have my own kids. This picture was taken on the triplets' first Christmas, and I still remember this day vividly. Oh, how I wish we were still this tiny and cute.
