<p>This one was a good one- I had absolutely no idea how it was going to end, and the plot twists were ridiculous. 5/5 stars</p>
<img alt="mistress" src="images/housemaid.jpg" style="width: 100%;"/>
<p>This one was on the more predictable side, but still very good. Reminded me a lot of the book "Verity" by Colleen Hoover. 5/5 stars for this one, and I recommend the second book, too.</p>
<img alt="crazyhouse" src="images/ward D.jpg" style="width: 100%;"/>
<p>One of my first reads this year, and I loved it. Frieda McFadden has the BEST plot twists. 5/5 stars, of course.</p>
<img alt="twins" src="images/phantom.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
<p>Phantom Limb. This one left my jaw on the floor. Holy Guacamole. 6/5 stars just because I think about this book on the daily.</p>
