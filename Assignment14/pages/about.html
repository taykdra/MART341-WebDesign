          <img src="images/friends.jpg" alt="bff" style="width: 100%;">
            <p> This one was a good one- I had absolutely no idea how it was going to end, and the plot twists were ridiculous. 5/5 stars </p>

          <img src="images/housemaid.jpg" alt="mistress" style="width: 100%;">
           <p> This one was on the more predictable side, but still very good. Reminded me a lot of the book "Verity" by Colleen Hoover. 5/5 stars for this one, and I reccomend the second book, too.  </p>

          <img src="images/ward D.jpg" alt="crazyhouse" style="width: 100%;">
           <p> One of my first reads this year, and I loved it. Frieda McFadden has the BEST plot twists. 5/5 stars, of course. </p>

          <img src="images/phantom.png" alt="twins" style="width: 100%;">
           <p> Phantom Limb. This one left my jaw on the floor. Holy Guacamole. 6/5 stars just because I think about this book on the daily. </p>
