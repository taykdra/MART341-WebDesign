            "The Outsider" is a novel by Stephen King, published in 2018. The story begins with the arrest of Terry Maitland, a
            respected Little League coach and teacher in a small town, for the brutal murder of a young boy. The evidence against
            Terry appears to be overwhelming, including eyewitness accounts and forensic proof.

            However, as the investigation unfolds, it becomes clear that there is something otherworldly about
            the case. Detective Ralph Anderson, who initially led the charge against Terry, begins to question the facts as he
            encounters contradictory evidence and inexplicable occurrences.

            As the narrative progresses, it delves into supernatural elements, suggesting that an ancient, shape-shifting entity is
            responsible for the crimes. The novel explores themes of doubt, the nature of evil, and the impact of collective fear
            and paranoia on a community. It combines elements of crime fiction and horror, keeping readers in suspense as they try
            to uncover the truth behind the murders and the enigmatic outsider.

            "The Outsider" is a gripping and atmospheric tale that showcases Stephen King's mastery of blending the mundane with the
            supernatural, creating a story that is both a crime thriller and a supernatural horror. This novel truly has you
            gripping your seat in anticipation, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone.
