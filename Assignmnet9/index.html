<h2>How Should You Edit Your Nature Photos?</h2>
    <div>

  <p> There is no specific way that you should edit your photos, because every picture is different. However, when I’m editing my photos, there are a few things that I modify each and every time. Keep in mind throughout this instructable that I’m not a professional photographer and that I just take photos for fun (: </p>

        <h2>First Things First</h2>
        <img src="./images/waterfall.jpeg" width="400" height = "600">
        <p>Here is one of my favorite photos of a small waterfall near the location I mentioned previously. To edit this photo, I used some of my favorite tricks, and I included those modifications below. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Lowering the highlights - brings out more detail</li>
            <li>2. Lowering the exposure - gives things a deeper, rich appearance</li>
            <li>3. Sharpening the photo - enhances the detail already present, makes it appear more HD</li>
<li>4. Increase the ambiance - brightens both color and light</li>
<li>5. Increase/decrease the shadows - depending on how deep/dark I want the photo, I will adjust this setting both ways. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Do You Take Your Photos on an Iphone?</h2>
        <p>I don’t always have my camera on me, but I do typically have my phone. I take pictures of everything, and the Live Photo feature that Iphone’s have has quickly become one of my favorite things. Why? This is because you can make modifications to these photos that make the photo totally awesome. The waterfall picture I shared previously is a perfect example here: this is because it’s a photo of moving water. To make the water appear blurred, I used the Live Photo feature to my advantage. Here’s how I got this effect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tap the “live” button in the top corner of your photo</li>
            <li>Tap the long exposure button at the bottom of the option list </li>
            <li>There you go! Now you have this blurred water effect that emphasizes the fact that the water is most certainly moving. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
 <h2>Another Waterfall Example</h2>

        <p>Although not my favorite, here’s another photo of a waterfall taken much closer to home. This one also shows this little hack in effect, and I still think it’s pretty great. If you would like to visit this waterfall for yourself, feel free to refer to the map below! </p>
