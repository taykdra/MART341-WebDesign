    <h1>Basic Photo Editing</h1>
       <p>There are so many different ways to edit your photos, and it really does depend on the context of the photo to determine how it should be edited. Editing is really fun, and itâ€™s a great way to develop your own personal style. While I shared some of my favorite and simple modifications, there are many more, and I encourage you to find some methods of your own. </p>
